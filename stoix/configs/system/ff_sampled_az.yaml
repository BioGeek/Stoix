# --- Defaults FF-Sampled-AZ ---

# This is an implementation of Sampled MuZero but using a perfect environment model for the search as in AlphaZero.
# Additionally, the search method used can be chosen between muzero mcts and gumbel mcts from mctx.
# Lastly, this version is designed with a Gaussian policy in mind.
